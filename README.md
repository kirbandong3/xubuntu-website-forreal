<h1> Why do we love dogs so much? </h1>
<p> Dogs are beautiful, they are like us, created by God we share a similar common similarity, we are loyal to one another. Dogs show a great sign of loyalty and of course treated and raised correctly they will un doubt become your best friend. They understand how we are feeling and are emphathetic and read our emotions. They will cheer us up during our company and make us active, giving your dog walks, play catch, or just someone to talk to. Not only do we love dogs but we love the fact that they make us resposnible to them as they are dependant on us making us feel like we are important to them like a parent </p>
